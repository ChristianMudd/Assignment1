Personal Information

Name: Christian Mudd

Student Number: S3791190

Background: I am an IT Professional in the process of changing careers away from IT towards accounting and finance. My career in IT spanned nearly 20 years and involved starting 2 companies.

Interest in IT

•	I think have always had an interest in IT, or at least from a very young age. My father collected a magazine series for me called “The Home Computer Course” (once collected you bound them all together into a 2-part encyclopedia) when I was barely at high school. Each magazine covered various aspects of IT including the application of computers to business, science, medicine, programming, hardware and software as well as computing history and a look into IT’s future. So from a young age I had a solid grip on many aspects of IT. I have always considered IT to be a tool not a career path, until one day I find myself at the end of what has been a solid career.
 
•	I have chosen to come to RMIT to expand my knowledge and obtain credentials in business, specifically financial planning. I expect that taking this subject will bring me more up to date with current IT trends and solidify knowledge I already have from my background in IT.

•	I expect that in the course of doing my studies at RMIT I will learn what it means to be a financial planner and gain the knowledge and confidence to create financial advice in the Australian market.

Ideal Job

•	I have completed this exercise as if I were to aim to remain in the IT industry, I think it helps the purpose of this assignment. Here is a link to my ideal job, somewhat aspirational. Here is a [screenshot](https://christianmudd.github.io/Assignment1/screenshot.png). 
•	The job is to oversee and direct digital and technology solutions across the business. It has fintech and property tech aspects as well as management of coding teams. What attracted me to this job is the challenge of working on the cutting edge of property, finance and technology. 

•	The following skills and experience would be required for this job. Project Management experience and skill with experience managing a diverse team. Coding experience and competence with a coding language and written code to the level of being able to deliver on a product roadmap. People skills to be able to cultivate relationships with leaders in the business for the success of the operation as a whole. Ability to identify new and emerging technologies, including industry trends, and be a champion for the business in its understanding and awareness of these technologies and their benefits to the business. Management and leadership skill to lead the head developer external to the business. Understanding of financial systems and processes at strategic level.

•	The following skills and experience I consider I already have. Project Management experience and skill with experience managing a diverse team. People skills to be able to cultivate relationships with leaders in the business for the success of the operation as a whole. Ability to identify new and emerging technologies, including industry trends, and be a champion for the business in its understanding and awareness of these technologies and their benefits to the business. Management and leadership skill to lead the head developer external to the business. Understanding of financial systems and processes at strategic level.

•	I need some more experience at coding, as my previous roles did not require much in the way of coding or management of coding teams. I would begin to build the experience necessary by taking on small project work as a subcontractor and build the necessary experience gradually.

I am an Auditory learner!

As an auditory learner, you learn by hearing and listening. You understand and remember things you have heard. You store
information by the way it sounds, and you have an easier time understanding spoken instructions than written ones. You often learn
by reading out loud because you have to hear it or speak it in order to know it.
As an auditory learner, you probably hum or talk to yourself or others if you become bored. People may think you are not paying
attention, even though you may be hearing and understanding everything being said.
Here are some things that auditory learners like you can do to learn better.
Sit where you can hear.
Have your hearing checked on a regular basis.
Use flashcards to learn new words; read them out loud.
Read stories, assignments, or directions out loud.
Record yourself spelling words and then listen to the recording.
Have test questions read to you out loud.
Study new material by reading it out loud.

Self-Awareness

Description: The core of Emotional Intelligence is self-awareness. Self-awareness is comprised of three competencies; emotional self-awareness, where you are able to read and understand your emotions as well as recognize their impact on work performance and relationships; accurate self-assessment, where you are able to give a realistic evaluation of your strengths and limitations; and self-confidence, where you have a positive and strong sense of one’s self-worth. The starting point and key in these areas is the ability to be critically self-reflective.

Self-Management

Description: Self-management is comprised of five competencies; Self-control, which is keeping disruptive emotions and impulses under control; transparency, which is maintaining standards of honesty and integrity, managing yourself and responsibilities; and adaptability, which is the flexibility in adapting to changing situations and overcoming obstacles; achievement orientation, which is the guiding drive to meet an internal standard of excellence; and initiative, which is the readiness to seize opportunities and act.

Social Awareness

Description: Social Awareness is comprised of three competencies; empathy, which is understanding others and taking an active interest in their concerns; organizational awareness, which is the ability to read the currents of organizational life, build decision networks and navigate politics; and service orientation, which is recognizing and meeting customers needs. The adaptable, success-oriented type.

Relationship Management

Description: The Social cluster of Relationship Management is comprised of seven competencies; visionary leadership, which is inspiring and guiding groups and individuals; developing others, which is the propensity to strengthen and support the abilities of others through feedback and guidance; influence, which is the ability to exercise a wide range of persuasive strategies with integrity, and also includes listening and sending clear, convincing and well-tuned messages; change catalyst, which is the proficiency in initiating new ideas and leading people in a new direction; conflict management, which is resolving disagreements and collaboratively developing resolutions; building bonds, which is building and maintaining relationships with others; and teamwork and collaboration, which is the promotion of cooperation and building of teams.
 

Summary of Personality Test Results

The personality tests above show that I am a highly evolved human, somewhat extroverted but highly diplomatic and feeling person who has good self-awareness, high social awareness as well as impressive relationship management skills. I am predominantly an auditory learner with some tactile preference but almost no visual style of learning.

In a team I would be diplomatic but assertive and respectful of others opinions regardless of whether I felt the same way or not. I would prefer to meet online and speak with my team members compared to sharing information by other means of communication such as email or chat forum.

When forming a team I think looking through personality test results of your fellow team members is an excellent way to get to know one another. The team building and execution process theory of forming, storming, norming then performing –having this information available up front would most likely accelerate the forming and storming stages so that norming and performing can happen sooner and the group function with efficiency at an earlier stage. 

Project Idea

Overview

The project idea is for a financial technology (fintech) application that helps people save money in several ways. There are so many apps out there to help people spend money and so few that help people save money. The idea is that this app (available on IOS and Android) is connected to your bank account and monitors what you spend your money on. The app then constantly squirrels away money based on a set of rules the user adopts when first setting up the app. The user's money is then transferred automatically to the savings account based on these rules.

Motivation

Saving money is one of the most challenging things for people to do. Many people start a saving habit only to find themselves not far down the track reverting to their old ways. My motivation behind this project is to help people put saving money on auto-pilot so that they do not have to think consciously about saving ...they simply do it as they go about their everyday life. An app that watches over your spending habits and reacts by saving money away according to a set of rules decided at setup is a wonderful way to unconsciously save money.

Description

The first thing that the user notices when they open this app (working title 'Savey') is that it is beautifully designed to be both simple and clear. The app shows them a recent history of their spending habits and also their recent savings history. It shows progress towards their saving goal in the form of a thermometer. Opening the app for the first time the app focuses on setting up security initially. Designed to take advantage of biometrics the app will request an email address which is then confirmed before biometrics are turned on. Once biometrics are turned on the app is secure until opened with face or fingerprint biometrics. The second step in the setup of the app is it needs to know your spending bank accounts and credit cards. A wizard steps the user through adding the various bank and credit cards that the user usually spends money with. These are called spending accounts (naturally).  Next the app wants to identify the savings account into which the savings will be transferred.  This is called the savings account (again, naturally). Next the app has a number of settings that can be combined to create a set of rules that create the savings. The first option is to set a regular amount to be transferred from a designated spending account. The user is also warned that they must have sufficient funds in the spending account (at all times) or the bank's usual fees for dishonoring a transfer will apply. The next option is called roundups. When round ups are turned on the app will monitor spending account transactions and keep a tally of all the round ups to the nearest dollar, add that together and on a daily or weekly basis transfer this tally of round ups to the savings account from the spending account. The next option is called match-ups and this designed to teach the app to recognize certain transactions and have the same amount transferred to the savings account. For example someone might purchase coffee regularly from their favorite coffee shop. This transaction if handled electronically (as opposed to using cash) can be identified by the savings app and be programmed to match the coffee payment into the savings account. Each time you drink coffee, you also save the same amount. The next feature that contributes to the savings account is call 'savings opportunity' and is activated after a month or so of using the app and it will prompt you to opportunistically save an amount based on an analysis of spare cash that it predicts to be in your spending account. Lastly the app has many 'savings partners' which are a host of online vendors that will rebate back to the user a percentage of the value of their purchase when using the vendor via the app. The vendors also pay Savey a small commission at the same time. This list of vendors is growing monthly as more and more vendors become aware of the app and join the savings promotion ecosystem. Users can share on Facebook that they have joined the app and referrals attract a small incentive (about the prices of a coffee).

Tools and Technologies

Tools required to develop this app across both Android and IOS would be presumably something along the lines of PhoneGap, which is a system to build hybrid cross-platform mobile apps using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We would also need access to banking APIs as well as very strong encryption APIs so that no banking passwords can ever be phished. Another option for developing the app might be Xamarin whereby we could use C# to build a mobile app that we can deploy natively to Android, iOS and Windows (although not sure that the Windows platform has enough users to worry about).

Skills Required

Skills required to achieve this project are as follows (at least). Graphic designer is required for creating the look and feel of the app. Then skilled programmers are required to build the app itself. Sales expertise is required to sell the app concept to and sign up the vendor partners. Marketing skills are then required for the best way to promote the app to get as wide a circulation as possible. It may mean partnering with a single Big Bank initially to obtain traction and some good negotiation skills would be required in order to land such an important partnership.

Outcome

If the project is successful, the outcome will be an app that is successful in helping millions of people save money in ways they never thought they could. Our original problem will be solved evidenced by reviews from people who were not able to save money previously, and can now demonstrate a tangible saving capacity using the app. The impact of this technology will be wide reaching. Instead of people trying to find credit or using systems like Afterpay to buy it now and pay for it later, people have the ability to save for the things they want and pay for it now, not later.
